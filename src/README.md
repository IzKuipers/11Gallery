# 11 Gallery

This application allows you to set Windows 11's built-in wallpapers as your wallpaper on ArcOS. It's got a bunch of wallpapers:

```
img0, img19, img20, img21, img22, img23, img24, img25, img26, img27, img28, img29, img30, img31, img32, img33, img34, img35, img100, img101, img102, img103, img104, img105
```

The files were taken from a genuine copy of Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Each wallpaper also has an associated thumbnail that has been scaled down to 192x120 using [paint.net](https://getpaint.net/).

## Known problems

- This application can become quite laggy if your system isn't super fast.
- It takes a second for ArcOS to catch up when you select a wallpaper, because the wallpapers are quite large. Be patient.
